## How to Use

(TODO: installation instructions)

Notes for later:

-   RemixIcon needs to be uploaded to ACP file manager because of same-origin policy enforcment on `use` elements.
-   Which also means that any place icons are `use`d, the URLs will need to be updated.
-   `macros/AVATAR.html` and `macros/AVATAR_URL.html` should be updated with actual default avatar.
-   Recent topics aren't enabled by default. System Settings/Topics, Posts, & Polls/Number of topics to show?
-   Don't forget to include how to update member group numbers (to match Jcink), as well as the actual colors
